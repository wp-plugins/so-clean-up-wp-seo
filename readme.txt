Clean up several things that the Yoast SEO plugin adds to your WordPress Dashboard

== Description ==

Almost anyone that uses Yoast SEO by Team Yoast will agree that it is *the* SEO plugin, but the developers are adding more and more unwanted things to the WordPress Dashboard.

The purpose of the SO Clean Up Yoast SEO is to clean up all those unwanted things.

As per the current release, the plugin removes and/or disables the following unwanted items:

* removes sidebar ads on all Yoast SEO settings pages
* removes the Yoast SEO settings from the Admin Bar
* removes updated nag
* sets plugin-intro-tour user_meta to true (means done)
* removes the keyword/description columns on edit Posts/Pages pages
* removes the overview dashboard widget that was introduced in version 2.3 of the Yoast SEO plugin 

We support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-clean-up-wp-seo/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the settings page? =

You can stop looking, there is none. Activate the plugin to clean up your WordPress dashboard.

= You have not any rating or review; why should I install this plugin? =

Yes, you are correct and many people say that it is important for a plugin to have a good rating. Some plugin developers rate their own plugins to get that first 5 star rating going, but I think that is [not playing fair](https://proplugindirectory.com/authors-rating-own-plugins/). Fortunately there are already quite a few people that have downloaded the plugin, installed it, activated it and keep it activated, as you can see from the Active Installs in the sidebar. There must be something good that the plugin does then, right?
So if you decide to install it and you're happy about the plugin, then please help the next person (and me) by [leaving a 5-star review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/so-clean-up-wp-seo?rate=5#postform). Thank you very much!

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.5 =

* We have changed the name of our plugin to reflect the name change of the plugin it cleans up after

= 1.4 =

* Version 2.2.1 of the Yoast SEO plugin changes a lot of things around. The automatic redirect to the plugin's About page is no longer, so we have removed the function that disables it. The new version introduced an updated nag that doesn't let itself be dismissed easily, so we have simply hidden it altogether. The super irritating balloon to follow the intro tour was back again too, we have countered that with a functiobn that sets the user_meta of that intro tour to true, which means "seen".
